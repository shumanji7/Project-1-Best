###**Project 1: Interactive Front-End Application ("ARE YOU SMARTER THAN A 5TH GRADER")**

Our project is an examination that settles the age-old question "Are you smarter than a 5th grader?" for the user. Using seemingly-generic facts that we all learn at a young age, we can determine whether the user has the IQ necessary to proceed in their educational career. At the homepage we request their information so we can follow-up with the university the user attends/has attended. This way, the university can reconsider their opinions of the user, if need be. 

Once the user has entered their information, we ensure they are ready to proceed to minimize the fault of the site for their failure. If they confirm that they are ready, the 1-minute timer begins. They have 5 questions to answer in the time or else the test will be deemed as incomplete. When they submit their exam, the results display immediately and get saved into storage. They will see the last submission the next time they attempt to take the exam. 

We also have a contact page if the user wishes to submit a plea for their poor performance or just have any general questions or comments.

In total, we have four HTML documents, two CSS documents, and two JS documents in our project. Each HTML page connects to another to ensure smooth transitions through the site. There is also one .gif file, one .jpg file and four url's to link images to our contact page.
